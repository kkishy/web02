ou might also get some help from reading a fantastic book by Brooks Landon called “Building Great Sentences.” Landon takes apart the scaffolding that makes great sentences and shows you how to put it back together in your own unique way. I also hope this list might be helpful for <a href="https://www.clien.net/service/" target="_blank" title="clien.net">teachers and professors of writing</a>, who want more lengthy sentence examples to show their students. If you want to teach short sentences, I’ve also compiled a list of those.The longest sentence in English is also awesome. <p>The longest sentence award goes to:Jonathan Coe’s The Rotter’s Club, 13,955 word sentence And for a runner-up: James Joyce, Ulysses, 4,391 word sentence And there are even one-sentence books — actually, a few of them. But I’m not reposting an entire book. And let’s end all this nonsense about how long sentences = run-on sentences. You can have a six-word run-on sentence (“I went shopping I ate donuts.”), while most of the sentences below are much, much longer than that and are not run-ons (except for a few examples like Jose Saramago).  But whether the sentence is grammatically correct isn’t nearly as important as whether the sentence is fun or beautiful.
